- Security Controls
  ● Identify
  ● Protect
  ● Detect
  ● Respond
  ● Recover
  I. Identify
- The identify category highlights the importance of understanding an organization’s critical
  assets and systems, along with their associated risks. Risks include anything that can impact
  the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. Organizations catalog their assets, like
  computers and other physical devices, data, and personally identifiable information. Then, they
  rank the severity of risks to each asset type, and identify gaps where security controls are
  necessary or need strengthening.
  II. Protect
- Protective controls shield cloud resources. There are several ways to implement this control
  type. For example, only authorized users should have access to the CSP’s hardware and
  software. This helps protect the provider’s physical devices and the software that runs on
  them. Another example of employing protective controls is establishing network integrity, like
  using firewalls and network segmentation. Protecting the network is crucial to safeguarding
  against various cyber attacks. Also, organizations should provide training to employees that
  raises awareness about potential cyber threats and provides information about how to prevent
  them.
  III. Detect
- Detective controls identify potential threats and events. Both physical and network
  environments should be monitored to alert for suspicious activities. Intrusion detection
  systems are commonly used to monitor and detect potential threats. Organizations can also
  use tools to detect phishing, malware, insecure libraries, and other threats and vulnerabilities.
  When a threat is discovered, it should be analyzed to discover more about the methods used
  to conduct the attack.
  IV. Respond
- Responsive controls involve many components, ranging from planning, to improving processes
  in the event of attacks, to disaster recovery. Responsive controls leverage automation in tools
  and applications to respond to detected security events or incidents. Once detective controls
  provide real-time alerts, and notify teams of security events, automated tools can help contain
  and mitigate incidents. Then, security teams can act on established processes that outline how
  to react in the event of incidents.
  V. Recover
- Recovery controls are important to restore access and performance when failures occur.
  Ensuring resources have high availability is one component that helps facilitate recovery.
  Replicating resources across zones and regions helps organizations restore assets quickly.
  Another control includes maintaining backup systems that can deploy in case of an attack.

* Key takeaways
  Security controls are an essential part of a defense in depth strategy. Using frameworks is one
  way to incorporate controls that help identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover cloud
  assets. As a cloud security professional, you’ll use these types of controls as a regular part of
  your job.
